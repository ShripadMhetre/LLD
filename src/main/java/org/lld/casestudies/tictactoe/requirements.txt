Q. What is Tic-Tac-Toe?
Ans: TicTacToe is a 2 player game played on a 3 x 3 board. Each player is allotted a symbol
    (one X and one O). Initially, the board is empty. Alternatively, each player takes a turn
    and puts their symbol at any empty slot. The first player to get their symbol over a complete
    row OR a complete column OR a diagonal wins.


Questions to Ask :-
- Will the game be played amongst only 2 players or can there be any number of players in future?
- Is the board size restricted to 3x3 or can it be any NxN?
- Can there be different ways to win?
- Can one of the players be a bot?
- Feature Suggestions:
  - Do we want to time a move? Skip/ Declare the other person as winner if the move doesnâ€™t
    happen within x seconds.
  - Do we want to support undo operation?
  - Can there be some players who are just watching? Not playing.
  - Do we want to store analytics? Basically previous games, who played what move etc.
  - Support for tournaments? Basically a set of matches, each match between 2 players
    of the tournament.

Expectations :-
- The code should be working and functionally correct
- Good software design practices should be followed:
- Code should be modular, readable, extensible
- Separation of concern should be addressed
- Project structured well across multiple files/ packages
- Write unit tests
- No need of GUI
